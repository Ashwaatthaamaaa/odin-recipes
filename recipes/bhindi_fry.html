    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In Hindi, Kurkuri means Crispy, Crunchy and Bhindi is Okra. This Okra Fry recipe is an easy snack or a side made with Bhindi (Ladies Finger).

        It is made with fresh and tender okra pods coated with gram flour (besan), ground spices and seasonings. This mixture is marinated and then shallow fried or deep fried.
        
        The gram flour or besan gives it a crispy texture and the spices give a bold, complex taste.
        
        This recipe is a North style recipe that I have learned from my mom. She would make kurkuri bhindi on occasions to go with chapatis. Her recipe would include all the ground spice powders that I have added, except chaat masala powder. This is the only change I have made to her recipe. The rest of it is the same.
        
        At times I bake and air-fried these too. The baked kurkuri bhindi fry tastes good but is not as crispy as the fried ones. But the air fried are more crispy. For health reasons, the baked ones are better. In the step by step post I have mentioned both baking and frying methods.
        
        I do not deep fry but shallow fry with less oil. When frying, I add oil as required, so that oil gets used up and there is no excess oil.
        
        This dish is great as a side dish with the combination of dal-rice, sambar-rice, curd-rice or even with plain chapati or paratha.
        
        At times as a side dish, I prepare Bhindi Fry to go with dal and rice. You can serve it with bread also.    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
