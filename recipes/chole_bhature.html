    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry.

        In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.
        
        This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chana curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a comforting taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.
        
        Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and chewy.    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          Soak 1 cup of chickpeas (chole) in water overnight or for at least 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the soaked chickpeas and rinse them thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a pressure cooker, add the chickpeas, 3 cups of water, 1 tea bag (optional for color), 1 teaspoon of tea leaves (optional), 1 teaspoon of salt, and pressure cook for 3-4 whistles or until the chickpeas are soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, prepare the Chole masala by sautéing 1 large chopped onion, 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste, and 2 chopped tomatoes in oil until they are soft and the oil starts to separate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, and sauté for a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the chickpeas are cooked, add them to the masala along with some water if needed. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the bhature, mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of semolina (sooji), 1/2 cup of yogurt, 1 tablespoon of oil, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Knead into a soft dough using water as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the dough and let it rest for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the dough into small balls and roll them out into circles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil for deep frying and fry the bhature until they puff up and turn golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the hot Chole with the bhature, along with chopped onions and lemon wedges.
