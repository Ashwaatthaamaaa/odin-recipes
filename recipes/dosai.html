    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A dosa is a thin savory crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. 
        Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew).Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.The dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE.[2] However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in present-day Karnataka.[3][4] Achaya also states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the 8th-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosa in Kannada literature appears a century late
